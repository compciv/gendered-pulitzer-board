          "safe_value": "<p><strong>Erwin D. Canham</strong>, who guided <em>The Christian Science Monitor</em> as its chief news executive for nearly three decades, died yesterday in Agana, Guam. It was under Mr. Canham&#39;s leadership that the churchsponsored paper attained its reputation for thoughtful, analytical coverage. Mr. Canham was 77 years old.</p><p>Mr. Canham underwent abdominal surgery on Guam two weeks ago. He and his wife, Patience, maintained homes on Saipan, where he had served as resident commissioner of the Northern Marianas Islands in the 1970&#39;s, and at Cape Cod, Mass.</p><p>Mr. Canham, a soft-spoken, genteel man with a puckish sense of humor, served the internationally circulated newspaper for 49 years as reporter, Washington bureau chief, columnist, managing editor, editor and editor in chief. He became editor emeritus in 1974 and five years later retired.</p><p><strong>Strengthened Foreign Coverage </strong></p><p>As the newspaper&#39;s editor from 1945 to 1964 and as editor in chief for the next 10 years, he strengthened <em>The Monitor</em>&#39;s coverage of foreign news and developed staff specialists in that and other areas.</p><p>&quot;The paper had had expert editors before him, and they were competent professionals, but a more intense journalistic competence was developed under Canham,&#39;&#39; said Saville R. Davis, former managing editor of the paper.</p><p>Mr. Canham was also respected for his knowledge of international affairs, familiarity with political and business leaders around the world and his many outside interests.</p><p>&#39;&#39;He was extremely speedy as a thinker and a writer,&#39;&#39; turning out a column and serving on outside comittees while putting out a newspaper, said the paper&#39;s editor, Earl W. Foell.</p><p><strong>Paper&#39;s Charter From Miss Eddy </strong></p><p>The Boston-based newspaper, which has a circulation of 180,000, has carefully adhered to the philosophy of Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science who established the publication in 1908 and said its goal would be &#39;&#39;to injure no man, but to bless all mankind.&#39;&#39;</p><p>In practice, this meant little emphasis on crime, violence and disasters, and greater attention to topics of long-term significance. In a departure from the practice at most other newspapers, <em>The Monitor </em>has given little attention to medical news because of the church&#39;s emphasis on spiritual healing. However, Mr. Canham said, this had its compensations because much medical news was of transient significance.</p><p>In explaining the newspaper&#39;s approach, Mr. Canham argued that, by the mid-1960&#39;s, radio and television had forced newspapers to go beyond &#39;&#39;the mere reporting of the event&#39;&#39; and that editors should &#39;&#39;press the task of reporting more deeply and widely.&#39;&#39; However, he warned that reporters must avoid coloring their articles with opinion.</p><p>Mr. Canham&#39;s career was an unusual combination of two deep interests: religious concern and a nose for news. A lifelong Christian Scientist, he taught a Sunday school class of college students at the Mother Church, near his office.</p><p>In 1966, he was given a one-year term in the largely honorary post of president of the church. In a worldwide lecture tour, he argued that the estrangement of science and religion was a mistake, adding, &#39;&#39;It is important to see that truth -spiritual truth - runs through all aspects of life.&#39;&#39;</p><p>Robert P. Hey, <em>The Monito</em>r&#39;s managing editor, said: &#39;&#39;He had quite an extraordinary gift for combining the big, broad canvas, in terms of national and international coverage, with the importance of the individual, no matter what his job. He made it his business to know something about and to care about you.&#39;&#39;</p><p>Erwin Dain Canham was born Feb. 13, 1904, in Auburn, Me. His father was agricultural editor of <em>The Lewiston</em> (Me.) <em>Sun and Journal</em>. Mr. Canham recalled that when he was 8 years old he stood on a chair in f ront of an old-fashioned wall telephone and took down items for publication. At 14, he became a general repor ter for the paper in theWorld War I manpower shortage.</p><p>He worked as a correspondent for up to eight daily newspapers while attending Bates College in Lewiston. Received Rhodes Scholarship</p><p>After graduating in 1925, he reported for <em>The Monitor </em>for a year before attending Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar. While there he covered the League of Nations for <em>The Monitor</em>.</p><p>Rejoining the newspaper full time, Mr. Canham covered national and international events, served as chief of the Washington bureau from 1932 to 1939, and was general news editor until 1942, when he became managing editor. Four years later he became the editor.</p><p>A year after being named editor emeritus, Mr. Canham was sent to Saipan by the United States Government to administer a plebiscite in which residents of the Northern Marianas Islands voted to withdraw from the American-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. He was Resident Commissioner from 1975 until 1978.</p><p><strong>Accepted Outside Positions </strong></p><p>Unlike some newspaper editors, Mr. Canham accepted a variety of outside posts. In 1948 he was vice chairman of the United States delegation to the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information. In the Eisenhower Administration, he was chairman of the National Manpower Council and a member of the Commission on Information, which helped shape United States policy on information and propaganda.</p><p>In 1959, he was president of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States. In the 1970&#39;s, he was a member of President Nixon&#39;s Commission on Campus Unrest and a member of the board of the Public Broadcasting Service. He was president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors in 1948-49.</p><p>Mr. Canham&#39;s first wife, the former Thelma Whitman Hart, died in 1967. In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Carolyn Shale Paul and Elizabeth Davis. -- (from The New York Times, Jan. 4, 1982 by William Dickie) Edward D.</p><p>Canham joined the Pulitzer Board in 1958.</p>"

He was 95.</p><p>Mr. Carroll had first joined <em>The Winston-Salem Journal and Sentinel</em> in 1949 as executive editor but left in 1955 to serve eight years as news editor of the Washington bureau of <em>The New York Times</em>. He returned to Winston-Salem as editor and publisher from 1963 to 1973. Under his direction, the paper favored gun control and busing to integrate public schools, positions unpopular with many North Carolinians.</p><p>Articles about environmental protection -- particularly a series on strip mining -- earned the paper the 1971 Pulitzer Prize for public service.</p><p>On March 17, 1968, he published a signed editorial in Winston-Salem under the headline &#39;&#39;Vietnam -- Quo Vadis?&#39;&#39; that argued that United States policy in Southeast Asia was misguided and irrelevant to the goal of thwarting Soviet expansion. Dean Acheson, the former secretary of state and an adviser to President Lyndon B. Johnson, showed the editorial to Johnson and stood by while the president read it. Later that month, Johnson announced that he would not run for re-election and would begin peace negotiations with North Vietnam. In an article about events leading to Johnson&#39;s announcement, <em>The Washington Post</em> reported that Mr. Carroll&#39;s editorial had influenced his thinking.</p><p>Two years later, Mr. Carroll wrote in another article: &#39;&#39;What we are losing is something more serious than the loss of any war or territory. It is the soul of America that is being lost in Vietnam. It is time for us to save the soul of America.&#39;&#39;</p><p>Wallace Carroll was born in Milwaukee on Dec. 15, 1906, and graduated from Marquette University. He began his journalism career as a reporter with The United Press in Chicago, and the news agency sent him to Europe to cover the Nazi advances. After the United States entered the war, Mr. Carroll became director of the United States Office of War Information in London. He was friendly there with James Reston, then a war correspondent in London for <em>The Times</em>. Mr. Reston wrote in his memoirs, &#39;&#39;Deadline,&#39;&#39; that Mr. Carroll emphasized &#39;&#39;with his usual common sense&#39;&#39; the importance of explaining United States policy to Americans and people in the allied countries but was often rebuffed by his superiors.</p><p>After the war, he wrote a book about his work, &#39;&#39;Persuade or Perish,&#39;&#39; and became executive editor in Winston-Salem. Mr. Carroll maintained his friendship with Mr. Reston, and in 1955, Mr. Reston, as Washington bureau chief of <em>The Times</em>, hired Mr. Carroll to be his deputy with the title of news editor. Mr. Carroll was in charge of day-to-day coverage.</p><p>In his history of <em>The New York Time</em>s, &#39;&#39;The Kingdom and the Power,&#39;&#39; Gay Talese wrote that James Reston offered to make Mr. Carroll bureau chief if he would stay at <em>The Times</em>. But Mr. Carroll declined the offer and in 1963, he returned to Winston-Salem to be editor and publisher.</p><p>Mr. Carroll&#39;s wife, Margaret, died last year. He is survived by a son, John S. Carroll, the editor of <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>, as well as by three daughters, Margaret Carroll of Washington, Rosamond Carroll of Kenfield, Calif., and Patricia Carroll of Arlington, Va.; four grandchildren and two great grandchildren.</p><p>After he retired in 1973, Mr. Carroll lectured for several years at Wake Forest University. Although Mr. Carroll spent most of his career as a news executive, Reston wrote that he had &#39;&#39;a studied respect for the English language&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;could have edited Lincoln&#39;s Gettysburg Address and improved it.&#39;&#39;</p><p>-- (New York Times, July 30, 2002 by David E.

He was 93.</p><p class=\"article\">He earned a law degree by the age of 29 while moving through newspapers in Oklahoma, Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee, and later became well versed in the financial side of the business, but Mr. Hills never strayed far from the newsroom.</p><p class=\"article\">Even as editor of <em>The Free Press</em>, he could not resist the lure of reporting -- a predilection that won him a Pulitzer Prize in 1955 for coverage of labor negotiations between the United Automobile Workers and the automakers. He later revealed that no less a figure than Henry Ford II had been a crucial source.</p><p class=\"article\">Five years later, as editor of <em>The Miami Herald,</em> he directed the newspaper&#39;s coverage of mob bosses living in the area, a series called &#39;&#39;Know Your Neighbor,&#39;&#39; which won that newspaper its first Pulitzer Prize.</p><p class=\"article\">Most of all, according to journalists who knew him, Mr. Hills saw probing, objective journalism as a calling and a public service. Mr. Hills -- an employee and friend of the late John S. Knight, who, with his brother James, owned the Knight newspaper group -- had sought to make the sharp, the curious, the critical and the crusading professionals around him adopt his standards of fairness, objectivity and excellence.</p><p class=\"article\">&#39;&#39;He knew full well the kind of journalism he had come into, a journalism of faction and interests and parochialism and provincialism, and of a brawling independence as well,&#39;&#39; said Hodding Carter, speaking of the 1920&#39;s and 1930&#39;s -- when Mr. Hills covered everything from lynchings to the crime career of Charles (Pretty Boy) Floyd.</p><p class=\"article\">&#39;&#39;But,&#39;&#39; Mr. Carter continued, &#39;&#39;he believed so strongly in the implications of a free press that he became one of the guys who helped to guide us into the period in which the adoption of standards and the notion of a semi-profession, with real connection to principle, and with the idea that the news came first and public interest came first.&#39;&#39;</p><p class=\"article\">Mr. Carter, who is president of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, added: &#39;&#39;He came up wanting above all else to be a good newspaperman, a good journalist. He became, in effect, the prime minister for Jack Knight as he created a newspaper organization that was solidly successful economically and held to the old values in journalism throughout.&#39;&#39;</p><p class=\"article\">Mr. Hills was born in Egg Creek Township, near Granville, N.D., in 1906. The family moved to Utah after his mother&#39;s death in 1911. It was in that state that he took his first job at a newspaper, sweeping floors at T<em>he Price News Advocate</em>.</p><p class=\"article\">He received his college education at Brigham Young University and the University of Missouri. While working as a reporter and editorial writer at T<em>he Oklahoma City Times</em>, which he joined in 1929, he earned a law degree. He later worked for that newspaper&#39;s competitor, <em>The Oklahoma News,</em> a Scripps-Howard newspaper, before introducing himself to John Knight in 1942.</p><p class=\"article\">According to the obituary in <em>The Detroit Free Press</em> yesterday, Mr. Hills, looking for a new job, asked to meet with Mr. Knight, who, with his brother, owned <em>The Akron Beacon-Journal, The Detroit Free Press </em>and <em>The Miami Herald</em>. Mr. Knight agreed to take him on as a news editor at <em>The Herald.</em> He soon became managing editor.</p><p class=\"article\">When the government rationed newsprint at the height of the war, Mr. Hills persuaded Mr. Knight to cut back on advertising to allow full space for war coverage.</p><p class=\"article\">Some of the reporting he made room for was his own, as he served briefly as a war correspondent for <em>The Herald</em>, and filed reports from the Far East, the Middle East and Latin America -- an area of the world that fascinated him. At <em>The Herald</em>, he supported extensive coverage of Latin America.</p><p class=\"article\">Even as the head of professional groups, he found a way to get back to his reporting roots. In 1962, touring the Soviet Union with 12 editors -- at the time he was president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors -- he got nationwide attention, reporting an interview with the Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev.</p><p class=\"article\">As John Knight&#39;s chief lieutenant, Mr. Hills served for the better part of three decades -- from 1951 to 1979 -- as executive editor or publisher of both <em>The Herald</em> and <em>The Free Press</em>.</p><p class=\"article\">Alvah Chapman, who, like Mr. Hills, served as a chief executive of Knight Ridder, said yesterday: &#39;&#39;Lee, of course, was both a business operator and a journalist. He was responsible for the business success as well as the editorial success of <em>The Detroit Free Press</em>. But he was best known for editorial skills and news skills.&#39;&#39;</p><p class=\"article\">Mr. Hills and Mr. Chapman, at Mr. Knight&#39;s behest, arranged the 1974 merger of Knight Newspapers Inc. with Ridder Publications Inc., producing a newspaper group that boasted a greater circulation than any of its rivals -- until the rapid growth of <em>USA Today</em> put the Gannett Company into the lead.</p><p class=\"article\">Mr. Hills was the first chairman and chief executive of the merged newspaper group. He retired as editorial chairman in 1981.</p><p class=\"article\">Mr. Hills was also an active philanthropist in both Detroit and Miami. Mr. Carter credits Mr. Hills with persuading the Knight brothers to set up the Knight Foundation with gifts amounting to more than $400 million. He also served as president of the Inter-American Press Association -- through which he met his third wife, Tina Ramos Hills.</p><p class=\"article\">Mr. Hills is survived by his wife and by Ronald Hills of Saratoga, Calif., his son with his first wife, Leona Hass, whom he divorced in 1944. His second wife, Eileen Whitman Hills, whom he married in 1948, died in 1961. He is also survived by two sisters, Louise Elwood, of Seattle, and BeverLee Margolis, of Mercer Island, Wash.; a brother, Stanley Hills, of Mercer Island; two grandsons and three great-grandsons.</p><p class=\"article\">Allen H. Neuharth, a colleague of Mr. Hills at <em>The Herald</em> and later, as founder of <em>USA Today</em>, a competitor, said yesterday: &#39;&#39;Among journalists, he was a reporter who never stopped being a reporter, even though he went on to be an executive and a publisher. But he retained his reporter&#39;s instincts and sensibility, and that motivated everything he did in his newspaper decisions.&#39;&#39;</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

He was 94.</p><p class=\"article\">Mr. Hohenberg also taught journalism for many years at Columbia University and wrote a widely used textbook on reporting. In all, he wrote 22 books -- including a novel at the age of 80 -- and maintained an arduous professional itinerary.</p><p class=\"article\">He wrote for numerous New York newspapers and taught at universities from New York to Tennessee to Florida to Kansas to Syracuse. He traveled the world, particularly Asia, lecturing for the State Department and other federal agencies. He began the practice of publishing the names of Pulitzer jurors and of drawing jurors from regions beyond New York.</p><p class=\"article\">Mr. Hohenberg came from the golden age of competitive newspapering, covering the 1935 trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann -- who was convicted of kidnapping Charles Lindbergh&#39;s baby -- hanging out with Hemingway in Paris and reporting on the birth pangs of the United Nations and Israel. Tom Goldstein, dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University, speaks of &#39;&#39;the John Hohenberg legend.&#39;&#39;</p><p class=\"article\">Mr. Hohenberg&#39;s larger mission was elevating journalism itself, and he viewed the painstaking selection of Pulitzer winners as another means of raising the bar.</p><p class=\"article\">&#39;&#39;Our news media, our reporters and editors -- if they are serious people and if they really mean business and aren&#39;t merely sensation-minded -- should be the conscience of the American people,&#39;&#39; he said in a 1988 interview in <em>The New York Times</em>.</p><p class=\"article\">He abhorred pomposity and wordiness, regarding journalism as a spontaneous ballet that could seldom be perfect because of daily deadlines. His motto, first growled to him by a crusty editor, was, &#39;&#39;Go with what you got.&#39;&#39; Generations of journalism students at Columbia committed the slogan to memory and the class of &#39;69 had it printed on sweatshirts.</p><p class=\"article\">Mr. Hohenberg was born on Feb. 17, 1906, in a tenement on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the son of Louis Hohenberg, a Hungarian immigrant, and Jettchen Scheuermann, an immigrant from Germany. When he was 18 months old, the family moved to Seattle, where his father set up several small businesses.</p><p class=\"article\">He started as an engineering student at the University of Washington but did not like it. His father refused to pay for the liberal arts education he wanted, so the gangling 17-year-old showed up at <em>The Seattle Star</em>, now closed, to ask for a job.</p><p class=\"article\">The response was brusque, he later recalled. &#39;&#39;Listen, kid,&#39;&#39; the city editor said, &#39;&#39;the president of the United States is coming to Seattle tomorrow. You get me an exclusive interview and I&#39;ll give you a job.&#39;&#39;</p><p class=\"article\">When the Secret Service demanded to see his nonexistent press credentials, employment seemed unlikely. He called the office, fearing that his name would mean nothing.</p><p class=\"article\">&#39;&#39;Mercifully,&#39;&#39; he wrote later, &#39;&#39;by grace of the kindly Jehovah that watches over babies, pretty girls and addled young men, the city editor remembered me and was sportsman enough to clear me for passage to the pier as a Star reporter.&#39;&#39;</p><p>The result was a second&#39;s conversation in which President Warren G. Harding allowed that he liked Seattle. Mr. Hohenberg turned the remark into a three-page story. &#39;&#39;For better or worse, I had become a newspaperman,&#39;&#39; Mr. Hohenberg said.</p><p class=\"article\">The family soon moved back to New York to be nearer relatives. While attending journalism school at Columbia, Mr. Hohenberg worked for T<em>he New York Graphic</em>, his first stop in 25 years of working for New York papers. After graduating, he toured Europe as the recipient of a Pulitzer Traveling Scholarship.</p><p class=\"article\">In 1948, as he was reporting on the establishment of the United Nations at Lake Success, N.Y., he was asked to substitute for a Columbia journalism teacher who had broken a leg. The students liked him, he liked the students and a new career began.</p><p class=\"article\">In 1960, he published what became the basic reporting and writing textbook used at many journalism schools, &#39;&#39;The Professional Journalist&#39;&#39; (Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston), which went through five editions and has been translated into Chinese, Japanese, Arabic and Spanish.</p><p class=\"article\">His 21 other books ranged from several histories of the Pulitzer Prize to an exhaustive history of foreign correspondence, recounting its beginnings in the Napoleonic Wars and offering long analyses of the challenges facing journalism.</p><p class=\"article\">Soon after his appointment in 1953 as administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes and secretary of the Advisory Board on Pulitzer Prizes, he nudged at least two members of the Pulitzer board into seeing all the plays under consideration for the drama prize, something not necessarily done before.</p><p class=\"article\">In later years, he wrote about how the Columbia trustees, as final arbiters, refused to accept the Pulitzer board&#39;s recommendation that <em>The New York Times </em>be given a prize in 1972 for its publication of stories based on the Pentagon Papers, the government&#39;s classified history of the Vietnam War.</p><p class=\"article\">The trustees were uneasy over the newspaper&#39;s decision to report classified material, an unusual action for journalists in that period. Columbia&#39;s president, William J. McGill, persuaded the trustees to reverse their decision.</p><p class=\"article\">Then, Mr. McGill and Mr. Hohenberg persuaded the trustees to yield veto power over the Pulitzers, perhaps the biggest procedural change during Mr. Hohenberg&#39;s tenure, which ended in 1975. The year before, he had accepted an appointment as professor of journalism at the University of Tennessee. That was the first of a chain of academic stops over the last two decades of his life.</p><p class=\"article\">Mr. Hohenberg married Dorothy Lannier, a classmate at Columbia, in 1928. She died in 1977. They had no children. He is survived by his second wife, JoAnn Fogarty Johnson, and her two children, whom he adopted: Pamela Green of Knoxville and Eric of Dawsonville, Ga.</p><p class=\"article\">In 1986, Mr. Hohenberg&#39;s wife found a yellowing manuscript on newspaper copy paper in the basement that turned out to be the skeleton of a spy novel he had abandoned in the 1920&#39;s. He whipped it into shape and sold it, under the title &#39;&#39;The Parisian Girl.&#39;&#39;</p><p class=\"article\">In 1976 he received a Pulitzer Prize special award for his service to journalism. The citation said thousands of journalists had learned to value his tough integrity.</p><p>&#39;&#39;From you they learned to respect the language,&#39;&#39; it read. &#39;&#39;They might split an infinitive because you taught them how. But they dare not dangle a participle. You forbid it.&#39;&#39;</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p>"

He was 89.</p><p class=\"article\">He died of heart failure, said his son, Stephen, a professor in the Journalism School.</p><p class=\"article\">Isaacs was a mentor to scores of students at Columbia as a lecturer and editor-in-residence from 1970 to 1980. He interrupted his Columbia career for a year, in 1975-76, when he was brought in as president and publisher of the daily newspapers of Wilmington, Del., to successfully resolve a management crisis and restore newsroom morale.</p><p class=\"article\">Isaacs was a highly regarded authority on journalism practice and ethics. He led the two Louisville papers during the 1950s and 1960s, when they won three Pulitzer Prizes, and where he created the first newspaper ombudsman.

There was some mistrust of journalism graduates by the old guard, and Waymack didn&rsquo;t give MacDonald much hope for a job, but he did mention that the news editor could use a copyreader. MacDonald walked out of Waymack&rsquo;s office, into the newsroom and told the news editor he was ready to start.</p><p class=\"article\" style=\"margin: 3px 0px 8px 5px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13.2px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">He was known for wanting the paper to remain statewide and Iowa to be progressive.

He was 80.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Pulitzer died of colon cancer, the publishing company said in a news release.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Tall, elegant and reserved, Mr. Pulitzer had, for the last seven years, served primarily as chairman of Pulitzer Publishing, which owns three newspapers, seven television stations and two radio stations. He had led Pulitzer Publishing and its flagship publication, <em>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em>, for 38 years, serving for 31 of those years as editor and publisher of the newspaper.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Pulitzer relinquished his positions with the paper in 1986 to devote his attention to the company, which went public that year. From 1955 to 1986, he served as chairman of the board of the Pulitzer Prizes, the highest awards in journalism, which were established by his grandfather.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;&lt;strong\"><strong>Avid Collector of Art</strong></p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Though principally identified with journalism, Mr. Pulitzer was widely recognized for the art collection he began as a student at Harvard University, a collection that ultimately became one of the most important and generously shared in the world.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Art News magazine called Mr. Pulitzer&#39;s acquisitions &quot;one of the most brilliant and comprehensive collections of modern art in the country,&quot; and John Russell of <em>The New York Times</em> described it as &quot;one of the most discriminating&quot; in the nation, saying it was &quot;as remarkable for range as for quality.&quot;</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Born on May 13, 1913, Mr. Pulitzer was baptized in the Episcopal Church as Joseph Pulitzer 3d, but he later adopted the junior designation, which his father had dropped after the death of the first Joseph Pulitzer.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Pulitzer graduated from St. Mark&#39;s School in Southborough, Mass., in 1932, and went on to earn his bachelor&#39;s degree in fine art from Harvard in 1936. His newspaper career began with a stint as a cub reporter for <em>The San Francisco News</em> in 1935, the summer before his senior year at Harvard. After graduating, he joined The Post-Dispatch news staff and helped cover the Roosevelt-Landon campaign of 1936.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;&lt;strong\"><strong>&#39;Illuminate Dark Places&#39;</strong></p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Over the next 20 years, he worked in every department of the paper, including periods as editor of the daily magazine and editor of the Sunday rotogravure, or pictorial. In 1948, he became associate editor, a position he held until he became editor and publisher on the father&#39;s death in 1955.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">In an editorial he wrote on the day he took over the paper, a week after his father&#39;s death, Mr. Pulitzer pledged that <em>The Post-Dispatch</em> would maintain its tradition as one of the nation&#39;s great crusading papers. &quot;We will not only report the day&#39;s news but illuminate dark places, and, with a deep sense of responsibility, interpret these troublous times,&quot; he wrote.</p><p>At the time, besides the newspaper, Pulitzer holdings included only a radio and television station in St. Louis. But under Joseph Jr.&#39;s guidance, the company bought <em>The Arizona Daily Star </em>in Tucson and <em>The Southtown Economist</em> in Chicago, six other television stations and another radio station.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">In 1986, the Pulitzer company faced its greatest financial challenge. It had accrued a large debt, and a group of dissident relatives who owned stock in the privately owned company found a buyer, A. Alfred Taubman, a Michigan real estate developer, who offered $625 million for the company. The company successfully resisted the takeover bid, going public with the stock in order to offset its debt.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">In 1989, the company faced another challenge when Ralph Ingersoll 2d began publishing <em>The St. Louis Sun</em>. Although that newspaper failed after only seven months, its presence spurred the staid Post-Dispatch to improve its coverage.</p><p><strong>A Litany of Firsts</strong></p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">During Mr. Pulitzer&#39;s tenure as editor, <em>The Post-Dispatch</em> won five Pulitzers, including prizes for commentary and editorial cartooning. In 1987, Mr. Pulitzer received a special citation from the Pulitzer Prize board, citing his &quot;extraordinary services to American journalism and letters.&quot;</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\"><em>The Post-Dispatch</em> was one of the first newspapers in the country to oppose the war in Vietnam, and it was also one of the first to publish excerpts from the Pentagon Papers, the secret history of the war.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">It was also the first paper in the country to replace the old letter-press printing process with offset cold-type printing, which allowed high-quality color printing. &quot;Color was of special interest to an art connoisseur like Mr. Pulitzer,&quot; the company&#39;s statement yesterday said, &quot;and at his insistence <em>The Post-Dispatch</em> moved early into color publication.&quot;</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\"><strong>Hobby Became a Passion</strong></p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Pulitzer&#39;s art collecting began simply enough in 1936 when as an undergraduate he bought Modigliani&#39;s &quot;Elvira Resting at a Table.&quot; Three years later, at an auction in Lucerne, Switzerland, he bought &quot;Bathers With a Turtle,&quot; by Matisse for $2,400, a piece that is now easily worth 10,000 times that amount.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Pulitzer&#39;s father had no enthusiasm for modern art and sometimes took his friends into his son&#39;s room to ridicule the purchases. &quot;He was convinced that I had been fleeced by shrewd and unscrupulous New York dealers,&quot; Mr. Pulitzer said in a speech earlier this year.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Later, when his father realized the value of his collection and asked where he learned so much about art, Mr. Pulitzer told him that the knowledge had been acquired at Harvard and that the elder Pulitzer had footed the bill.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">The Pulitzer Collection came to include 86 pieces, all of which were shown at the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Mass., in 1988. The collection could have included Picasso&#39;s seminal work &quot;Demoiselles d&#39;Avignon,&quot; but Mr. Pulitzer had bought it before World War II and then donated it to the Museum of Modern Art.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Pulitzer always insisted on anonymity when lending his works to museums.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">His collection included Vuillard&#39;s &quot;Self Portrait,&quot; and &quot;Head of a Man&quot; by Degas, one of Monet&#39;s &quot;Water Lilies,&quot; as well as works by Braque, Picasso and Miro.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Pulitzer&#39;s first wife, Louise Vauclain, died in 1968. He married again in 1973, to the former Emily S. Rauh, who at the time was curator of the St. Louis Art Museum.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">He is survived by his son, Joseph Pulitzer 4th; his half brother, Michael of St. Louis, two sisters, Kate Davis Quesada of Hobe Sound, Fla., and Elinor Hempelmann of Rochester, and four grandchildren.</p></div></div></div>"

          "safe_value": "<p><em>New York Times</em> obituary, July 23, 1996</p><p><strong>Vermont Royster</strong>, a former editor of <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>who won two Pulitzer Prizes and helped to shape his newspaper into the country&#39;s leading business daily, died yesterday in a retirement community in Raleigh, N.C., <em>The Journal </em>said. He was 82.</p><p><em>The Journa</em>l said Mr. Royster had been in ill health for several years.</p><p>Mr. Royster started as a reporter at <em>The Journal</em> in 1936 and worked his way up the ranks, becoming Washington correspondent, Washington bureau chief, editorial writer and editor.</p><p>Mr. Royster was also a senior vice president for Dow Jones &amp; Company, the newspaper&#39;s publisher, and was a director of the company. After his 1971 retirement, he was named editor emeritus of <em>The Journal </em>and continued to write his weekly column, <em>Thinking Things Over</em>, until 1986.</p><p>Mr. Royster won his first Pulitzer in 1953, for editorial writing. The Pulitzer was awarded not for a specific editorial but for his work in general, which was praised for its &quot;warmth, simplicity and understanding of the basic outlook of the American people.&quot;</p><p>In awarding him his second Pulitzer, in 1984, for distinguished commentary, the judges cited his column for its compassion and for putting contemporary events in a historical context.</p><p>Vermont Connecticut Royster was born in Raleigh. His given names were the same as those of his grandfather, whose own father named his children after states in the Union.</p><p>Mr. Royster graduated from the University of North Carolina and was a reporter for several newspapers in his home state before joining <em>The Journal</em>.</p><p>Mr. Royster interrupted his journalistic career to serve in the Navy during World War II. He was on convoy duty in the Atlantic and later served in the Pacific. He commanded a submarine chaser, a gunboat and a destroyer escort.</p><p>In person and in print, Mr. Royster was known for the gentle tone and rigorous thought that underlay his words. He was, in the words of one fellow journalist, &quot;a gentle essayist among the shrillers of his time.&quot;</p><p>In 1953, Mr. Royster deplored the fact that some businessmen were discussing the truce in Korea in terms of bull markets and bear markets. &quot;War itself is a terrible thing,&quot; he wrote, &quot;but we find more terrible the fact that there are men walking about who talk of peace as if it were terrible.&quot;</p><p>In 1962, Mr. Royster was one of a group of American newspaper editors who had an audience with Nikita S. Khrushchev in which the Soviet leader said that, while he would rather invest in farm machinery than in rockets, his country had an anti-missile missile that could hit &quot;a fly in outer space.&quot;</p><p>After retiring from <em>The Journal,</em> Mr. Royster became a professor of journalism and public affairs at the University of North Carolina.</p><p>In 1967, Mr. Royster&#39;s book &quot;A Pride of Prejudices,&quot; a collection of some 100 editorials he wrote over two decades, was published by Knopf. His 1983 book, &quot;My Own, My Country&#39;s Time: A Journalist&#39;s Journey,&quot; published by Algonquin Books, was an account of his childhood, his combat experiences and his years as a journalist.</p><p>In 1986, Mr. Royster received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#39;s highest civilian award. Mr. Royster, President Reagan said, had a common sense &quot;that exploded the pretensions of &#39;expert opinion,&#39; and his compelling eloquence warned of the evils of a society loosed from its moorings in faith.&quot;</p><p>Mr. Royster is survived by his wife, Frances, and two daughters.</p>"
