Christopher,</strong>&nbsp;68, an author and former editor at&nbsp;<em>Time</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Newsweek</em>&nbsp;magazines, had been secretary of the Pulitzer Prize Board and administrator of Pulitzer Prizes at Columbia University since 1981. A resident of Old Lyme, Conn., he died of emphysema Sunday in Lawrence and Memorial Hospital, New London, Conn.</p><p>&quot;He did an excellent job in guiding the board in its many tough decisions,&quot; Pulitzer Prize Board president Claude Sitton said. &quot;He was personally a warm and wonderful fellow who was admired by all of us. He was also a great repository of information about the Pulitzers.&quot;</p><p>For the last 11 years, Mr. Christopher administered the annual selection of Pulitzer Prizes, arranging for the selection of jurors, handing in the thousands of entries and serving as a non-voting member of the Pulitzer Prize Board. Awards are made in 21 areas of journalism, letters, drama and music.</p><p>The prestigious awards are announced by the president of Columbia University, where Mr. Christopher has been an adjunct professor in writing. Changes in the awards over recent years have seen increases in the monetary size of the prizes, to $3,000 from $1,000, and in the record number of women, 11, winning Pulitzer Prizes in 1991.</p><p>Mr. Christopher, a native of Thomaston, Conn., graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Yale University. During World War II and the Korean War, he served as an officer in Army intelligence.</p><p>He spent 13 years at&nbsp;<em>Time</em>&nbsp;magazine in positions that included associate editor and Rome correspondent.
