Her book <em>The World of Prometheus: The Politics of Punishing in Democratic Athens</em> examines the theory and practice of punishment in classical Athens as it affected both the intellectual elite and ordinary citizens. Allen weaves evidence from legal statutes and court speeches with contemporaneous literary and philosophical documents to explore the challenges posed by punishment to democratic Athenian politics and society.</p><p class=\"article\">Allen&#39;s work contributes new perspectives to discussions of race and politics that go well beyond the confines of traditional and canonical scholarship. Her latest book, Talking to Strangers: Anxieties of Citizenship Since Brown v. Board of Education, combines brief readings of philosophers and political theorists with personal reflections on race politics in Chicago. By doing so, Allen proposes strikingly practical techniques of citizenship that she hopes can help us become more trustworthy to others and overcome the fossilized distrust among us.</p><p class=\"article\">A 2001 MacArthur Fellow, Allen is a professor in the University of Chicago&#39;s departments of the classics and political science and in the Committee on Social Thought. She received a B.A. from Princeton University, an M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard University, and an M.Phil. and Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge.

VandeHei is the first representative of a primarily online news organization to serve on the Pulitzer Board.</p><p>VandeHei, along with journalist John F. Harris and Allbritton Communications, launched Politico in early 2007 and quickly established it as a leading new media company. <em>Vanity Fair </em>recently named VandeHei among the 100 most powerful Information Age thinkers for helping create the &quot;model for the new media success story.&quot; Drawing on 15 years of experience in Washington journalism,</p><p>VandeHei helps direct Politico&rsquo;s editorial content and oversee its business strategy. The company, with more than 100 employees, blends the old media values of fairness and accuracy with the speed and immediacy of new technologies. Politico&rsquo;s Web site reaches more than 3 million unique visitors each month, and its Washington-based newspaper is distributed to more than 30,000 senior government officials, staff, lobbyists and political professionals.</p><p>VandeHei, a native of Oshkosh, Wis., is a regular political analyst on MSNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Morning Joe&rdquo; and is a frequent guest on numerous cable and network television programs. He co-moderated two televised presidential debates during the 2008 campaign with MSNBC and CNN, including the first debate to incorporate questions voted on by a live online audience.&nbsp;</p><p>He is also a public speaker, giving speeches and moderating debates and panel discussions on politics, new media and the future of journalism.</p><p>VandeHei graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh in 1994 with degrees in journalism and political science. He became interested in journalism after covering sports for the <em>Oshkosh Daily Northwestern</em> and then running <em>The Brillion News</em>, a small-town weekly in Wisconsin, in the summer of 1993.</p><p>VandeHei moved to Washington in 1995 to pursue a career in political journalism. His first job was reporting on the alternative fuels industry for <em>New Fuels Report</em>, a weekly newsletter. In 1996, he started writing for<em> Inside the New Congress</em>, a now-defunct weekly newsletter that covered the House and the Senate. Soon afterward, VandeHei became congressional correspondent for <em>Roll Call</em>, where he covered the fall of House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the battles for power within the Republican majority.</p><p><em>The Wall Street Journal </em>recruited VandeHei in 1999 to cover Capitol Hill. He was named White House correspondent for the<em> Journal</em> in 2000, and he covered the first year of President George W. Bush&rsquo;s administration.</p><p>In 2002,&nbsp;<em>The Washington Post</em> offered VandeHei a position covering Congress, and he was soon tapped to cover the Democratic fight for the presidential nomination in 2004, followed by the general election. He served as one of the<em> Post&#39;</em>s White House correspondents during the first year of Bush&rsquo;s second term, a beat that was expanded to include politics and governance in 2005.&nbsp;</p><p>VandeHei&#39;s political editor at the <em>Post</em> was John F. Harris. The two came up with the idea of launching Politico in 2006 with Mike Allen, then of <em>Time </em>magazine, and several others. VandeHei and Harris left the Post in November 2006 to start the new venture with Robert L. Allbritton, now publisher, and Frederick J. Ryan Jr., CEO, of Politico.</p><p>VandeHei joined the Pulitzer Prize Board in 2010.</p>"

          "safe_value": "<p><strong>Robert Blau</strong> is managing editor for projects and investigations at Bloomberg News, a global newsgathering organization. Blau has carved an eclectic path up the journalistic ranks. After a stint as a freelancer writing about music, he was hired in 1985 by the<em> Chicago Tribune</em>, where his first job was reviewing the movies that Gene Siskel, the paper&rsquo;s famed critic, didn&rsquo;t want to. He moved on to the crime beat, capturing the experience in a memoir, <em>The Cop Shop</em>. Later, as an investigative reporter, he covered everything from mobsters in Chicago to the plight of impoverished children in Cambodia. A series he designed on population issues, &quot;Gambling with Life,&quot; including his portrait of a Chicago mother of 13 children, won the Overseas Press Club award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. His inaugural editing job was reinventing the paper&rsquo;s opinion section as a home for first-person narrative, from an account of one family&#39;s alcoholism to Saul Bellow&rsquo;s reconstruction of the Democratic conventions of his youth. Following a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard in 1997, Blau assembled the Tribune&rsquo;s projects team, which produced a burst of outstanding work. The team&rsquo;s body of work on the criminal-justice system was largely responsible for the moratorium on capital punishment in Illinois, won numerous national awards and sparked similar investigations across the country. &quot;Gateway to Gridlock,&quot; about the failures of the airline industry, was awarded the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting. Another multi-part narrative traced the fatal trajectory of a single pane of glass that fell from a Chicago skyscraper. And a project portrayed the final days of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen. Each was a Pulitzer finalist. While Blau served as managing editor of The Baltimore Sun, the paper produced a steady stream of investigative work, collecting dozens of honors including the George Polk Award, the Meyer Berger Award, the Loeb Award and the Investigative Reporters and Editors Prize. An investigation into Baltimore&rsquo;s system of &quot;ground rent&quot; was a Pulitzer finalist in Local Reporting. Blau also reorganized the Sun newsroom for the Internet and helped establish a Web-first newsgathering operation. Blau joined Bloomberg News in 2008, and has helped lead its push into global public-service journalism. Its investigations have forced unprecedented transparency from the Federal Reserve, documented the unanticipated ripples of the Lehman Brothers collapse, explored the human cost of the gold-mining industry and tallied the economic and emotional price of end-of-life health care. Blau, a native of New York City, received his undergraduate degree from the State University of New York at Albany, where he studied literature and journalism with novelist William Kennedy. He earned his master&rsquo;s degree from Columbia University&rsquo;s Graduate School of Journalism in 1985. He was a Pulitzer juror in 2010 on the Investigative Reporting jury, and chaired the Public Service jury&rsquo;s deliberations in 2011. Blau is married to Leah Eskin, a food columnist. They have two children, Hannah and Noah. The family lives in Baltimore. Blau joined the Pulitzer Prize Board in Fall, 2011.</p>"
