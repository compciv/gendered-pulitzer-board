Her book <em>The World of Prometheus: The Politics of Punishing in Democratic Athens</em> examines the theory and practice of punishment in classical Athens as it affected both the intellectual elite and ordinary citizens. Allen weaves evidence from legal statutes and court speeches with contemporaneous literary and philosophical documents to explore the challenges posed by punishment to democratic Athenian politics and society.</p><p class=\"article\">Allen&#39;s work contributes new perspectives to discussions of race and politics that go well beyond the confines of traditional and canonical scholarship. Her latest book, Talking to Strangers: Anxieties of Citizenship Since Brown v.

By doing so, Allen proposes strikingly practical techniques of citizenship that she hopes can help us become more trustworthy to others and overcome the fossilized distrust among us.</p><p class=\"article\">A 2001 MacArthur Fellow, Allen is a professor in the University of Chicago&#39;s departments of the classics and political science and in the Committee on Social Thought.

He oversees its day-to-day editorial operations, long-term projects and Web strategy. During his time as managing editor, ProPublica became the first online news organization to win Pulitzer Prizes. In 2010, it won the Investigative Reporting prize for chronicling the life-and-death decisions by a hospital&rsquo;s exhausted doctors when they were isolated by the floodwaters of Hurricane Katrina. A year later, it won the National Reporting prize for exposing Wall Street practices that contributed to the nation&rsquo;s economic meltdown. Before joining ProPublica, he worked for <em>The Norfolk Virginian-Pilot, The Dallas Morning News, The New York Times</em> and <em>The Oregonian</em> of Portland, Ore., where he was a managing editor. During his years at <em>The Oregonian</em>, the paper won the Pulitzer for Breaking News Reporting and was a finalist for its investigative work on methamphetamines and on charities intended to help the disabled. Engelberg was with <em>The Times</em> for 18 years, including stints in Washington, DC, and Warsaw, Poland, as well as in New York. After serving as the bureau chief in Warsaw following the collapse of Communism, he resumed work as an investigative reporter. Engelberg shared in two George Polk Awards for reporting: the first, in 1989, for articles on nuclear proliferation; the second, in 1994, for articles on U.S. immigration. He was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize as a reporter in 1998 for an investigation of the crash of a commuter airplane. Since 1996, Engelberg has concentrated on editing investigative projects. Engelberg was the first editor of The Times&rsquo; investigative unit and directed teams of reporters who won Pulitzer Prizes for national, foreign and explanatory journalism. Among the winning projects were ones that examined Mexican corruption (published in 1997) and the rise of Al Qaeda (published beginning in January 2001). Engelberg is the co-author of <em>Germs: Biological Weapons and America&rsquo;s Secret War.</em> He shared an Emmy in 2001 for work on a documentary on biological warfare by the PBS program Nova. A native of Lexington, Mass., Engelberg graduated from Princeton University in 1979 with a degree in history. He lives in Montclair, N.J., with his wife, Gabrielle Glaser, and three daughters. Stephen Engelberg joined The Pulitzer Prize Board in 2012.</p>"

          "safe_value": "<p><strong>John Daniszewski </strong>became AP&rsquo;s vice president for international news in 2009 after three decades as a reporter, editor and correspondent who has been on assignment in more than 70 countries in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia. He is responsible for more than 500 editors and reporters in some 100 bureaus outside the United States producing coverage from some of the most complex and challenging news-gathering environments. Daniszewski played a central role in AP&rsquo;s opening of the first Western news and photo bureau in Pyongyang, North Korea, in 2012, and the Yangon, Myanmar, bureau earlier in 2013 -- the first return to that country by a Western news agency after decades of strict military rule. He worked for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> from 1996-2006, serving as bureau chief in Cairo, Moscow, Baghdad and London. In 2001, he covered the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and he stayed in Baghdad throughout the U.S. invasion and the toppling of Saddam Hussein&#39;s regime in 2003. He was part of a team that won an Overseas Press Club award in 2007 and that was a Pulitzer Prize finalist that year for coverage of Iraq&rsquo;s descent into civil war. Daniszewski began his journalism career as a stringer for the AP while an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania. He joined the AP staff in Philadelphia in 1979 and later worked in Harrisburg and on the national and international editing desks in New York. In 1987, he was assigned overseas to Warsaw, Poland. There he covered the revival of Solidarity and the end of Communist rule. In 1989, he was shot and wounded in Timisoara, Romania, during the uprising against Nicolae Ceausescu&rsquo;s communist regime. He later covered wars across the former Yugoslavia, including the siege of Sarajevo. In 1993, he became AP&rsquo;s bureau chief in Johannesburg, South Africa. He led the AP&rsquo;s coverage of the election of President Nelson Mandela and the end of apartheid before leaving in 1996 to go to the Times. He returned to AP as international editor in 2006 and was named a managing editor the next year. Daniszewski graduated from the University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Wharton School. An Ohio native, he is married to Dru Menaker, senior media advisor for the international development organization IREX. They live in Nyack, NY, and have two children in college, Benjamin and Anna. He is a member of the North American Committee of the International Press Institute and the Board of Governors of the Overseas Press Club Foundation. John Daniszewski joined the Pulitzer Prize Board in 2014.</p>"

          "safe_value": "<p><strong>Robert Blau</strong> is executive editor at Bloomberg News, a global newsgathering organization. Blau has carved an eclectic path up the journalistic ranks. After a stint as a freelancer writing about music, he was hired in 1985 by the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, where his first job was reviewing the movies that Gene Siskel, the paper&rsquo;s famed critic, didn&rsquo;t want to. He moved on to the crime beat, capturing the experience in a memoir, <em>The Cop Shop</em>. Later, as an investigative reporter, he covered everything from mobsters in Chicago to the plight of impoverished children in Cambodia. A series he designed on population issues, &quot;Gambling with Life,&quot; including his portrait of a Chicago mother of 13 children, won the Overseas Press Club award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. His inaugural editing job was reinventing the paper&rsquo;s opinion section as a home for first-person narrative, from an account of one family&#39;s alcoholism to Saul Bellow&rsquo;s reconstruction of the Democratic conventions of his youth. Following a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard in 1997, Blau assembled the Tribune&rsquo;s projects team, which produced a burst of outstanding work. The team&rsquo;s body of work on the criminal-justice system was largely responsible for the moratorium on capital punishment in Illinois, won numerous national awards and sparked similar investigations across the country. &quot;Gateway to Gridlock,&quot; about the failures of the airline industry, was awarded the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting. Another multi-part narrative traced the fatal trajectory of a single pane of glass that fell from a Chicago skyscraper. And a project portrayed the final days of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen. Each was a Pulitzer finalist. While Blau served as managing editor of <em>The Baltimore Sun</em>, the paper produced a steady stream of investigative work, collecting dozens of honors including the George Polk Award, the Meyer Berger Award, the Loeb Award and the Investigative Reporters and Editors Prize. An investigation into Baltimore&rsquo;s system of &quot;ground rent&quot; was a Pulitzer finalist in Local Reporting. Blau also reorganized the Sun newsroom for the Internet and helped establish a Web-first newsgathering operation. Blau joined Bloomberg News in 2008, and has helped lead its push into global public-service journalism. Its investigations have forced unprecedented transparency from the Federal Reserve, documented the unanticipated ripples of the Lehman Brothers collapse, explored the human cost of the gold-mining industry and tallied the economic and emotional price of end-of-life health care. Blau, a native of New York City, received his undergraduate degree from the State University of New York at Albany, where he studied literature and journalism with novelist William Kennedy. He earned his master&rsquo;s degree from Columbia University&rsquo;s Graduate School of Journalism in 1985. He was a Pulitzer juror in 2010 on the Investigative Reporting jury, and chaired the Public Service jury&rsquo;s deliberations in 2011. Blau is married to Leah Eskin, a food columnist. They have two children, Hannah and Noah. The family lives in Baltimore. Blau joined the Pulitzer Prize Board in Fall, 2011.</p>"

In 2012, she won the National Book Award for Nonfiction for &quot;Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity,&quot; which examined life in the airport slums of Mumbai, India. The book, which was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in Nonfiction, also won nonfiction prizes from PEN, the Los Angeles Times Book Awards, the New York Public Library and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Reared in and around Washington, D.C., Boo began her journalism career at the Washington City Paper and later worked at <em>The Washington Monthly</em>. She joined <em>The Washington Post</em> in 1993, serving first as an editor in the Outlook section, then as an investigative reporter. She left in 2001 to write for <em>The New Yorker</em>. One of her <em>New Yorker</em> articles, &quot;The Marriage Cure,&quot; examined efforts to teach poor people in an Oklahoma community about marriage in the hope that it would help them rise out of poverty. The piece won the National Magazine Award for Feature Writing in 2004. Another <em>New Yorker</em> article, &quot;After Welfare,&quot; won the 2002 Sidney Hillman Award, honoring work that advances social justice. Boo graduated summa cum laude from Barnard College and in 2002 received a McArthur &quot;genius&quot; award.
