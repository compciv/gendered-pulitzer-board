          "safe_value": "<h3>&quot;When I think of Oz Elliott, I think of a person who embodies all the qualities of a good citizen&mdash;a practical man of high ideals, a courageous man who exercises self-restraint, a worldly man who loves his city.&quot; &mdash;David Dinkins, <i>Newsweek,&nbsp;</i>09/27/08</h3><p><strong>Osborn Elliott, Father of Newsweek&rsquo;s Rebirth, Dies at 83 </strong></p><p>By Michael T. Kaufman</p><p><strong>Osborn Elliott</strong>, the courtly editor who revitalized <em>Newsweek </em>magazine in the 1960s before he went on to serve as a $1-a-year deputy mayor in charge of economic development for a financially desperate New York City, died at his home in Manhattan on Sunday. He was 83. He died of complications of cancer, said his daughter Dorinda Elliott.</p><p>When Mr. Elliott became <em>Newsweek</em>&rsquo;s managing editor in 1959, the magazine lagged appreciably behind its chief competitor, <em>Time,</em> in circulation and advertising, and aped the sort of terse and idiosyncratic writing that <em>Time </em>had introduced. But Mr. Elliott, who rose to editor in 1961, was willing to experiment with formula and take a more ambitious journalistic path for <em>Newsweek</em>.</p><p>The magazine began shunning the backward-running sentences that <em>Time</em> and its founder, Henry R. Luce, favored, and it started giving reporters bylines, breaking a long news magazine practice of anonymous writing. More substantively, it began producing in-depth polling on national issues. In cover articles, often to attract a younger readership, it examined the war in Vietnam and the mounting opposition to it, the civil rights movement, racial unrest in the cities, popular culture, and the counterculture. The perspectives were generally liberal, as had been the case from the beginning of Newsweek&rsquo;s rivalry with <em>Time</em>, which generally reflected the conservative outlook of Mr. Luce.</p><p>On Nov. 20, 1967, in a departure from its tradition of neutrality, <em>Newsweek</em> moved toward open advocacy with a 23-page section titled &lsquo;The Negro in America: What Must Be Done.&rdquo; In an editorial &mdash; the first in what was then the magazine&rsquo;s 34-year history &mdash; <em>Newsweek</em> offered a 12-point program on how to accelerate the passage of black Americans into all aspects of society. The Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism recognized the series in giving <em>Newsweek</em> its Magazine of the Year Award.</p><p>Newsweek also gave prominent coverage to the women&rsquo;s movement &mdash; &ldquo;Women in Revolt,&rdquo; one cover said &mdash; though in 1970 the magazine itself was the subject of a federal discrimination complaint by 46 young women on its news staff, most of them hired as researchers to check facts, saying they had been denied writing positions because of their sex. Mr. Elliott, defending the magazine, said that most researchers were women because of a &ldquo;news magazine tradition going back to almost 50 years.&rdquo; In a negotiated agreement, the magazine promised to accelerate recruitment and promotion of women.</p><p>During Mr. Elliott&rsquo;s tenure, <em>Newsweek</em>&rsquo;s circulation, which stood at almost 1.5 million in 1961, rose to more than 2.7 million by 1976, the year he left, though even then it still trailed <em>Time</em> by nearly a million readers. Mr. Elliott reveled in the job. &ldquo;I had interviews with five presidents, audiences with two popes and the emperor of Japan,&rdquo; he wrote in 1977, reflecting on his career in an article in <em>The New York Times Magazine,</em> adding that he had &ldquo;spent the most interesting and moving week of my life living, and learning, in the black ghettos of America.&rdquo;</p><p>But he conceded that the pace in running the magazine was grueling and that he had promised himself to lessen his burden when men had landed on the moon. Thus, in 1969, he moved on to what he called the nonexistent job of editor in chief. He later had the titles of president, chief executive and board chairman.</p><p>Mr. Elliott left <em>Newsweek</em> in 1976 to become New York&rsquo;s first deputy mayor for economic development. The year before, at the urging of Senator Jacob K. Javits, he had formed and led the Citizens Committee for New York City, a private group founded to organize volunteers for projects the city could no longer afford to finance.</p><p>The city was nearly bankrupt and had lost almost 650,000 jobs in the previous seven years. Its economic development administrator had resigned. Mayor Abraham D. Beame asked Mr. Elliott to take over the development agency and restructure it as the Office of Economic Opportunity. In taking the job at $1 a year, Mr. Elliott said a nominal salary would put him above the political process and give him more credibility with businesses. Charged with attracting businesses to the city, he shifted the emphasis from large corporations to smaller enterprises with fewer than 100 workers.</p><p>His turn as a public servant was brief. In 1977, he resigned to become dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, a position he held until 1986, when he stepped down, although he stayed on as the George T. Delacorte Professor until 1994.</p><p>With his liberal urban enthusiasms &mdash; he helped organize a Save Our Cities march on Washington in 1992 &mdash; his polka-dot bow ties and his conservatively cut suits, Mr. Elliott was a familiar, old-money figure in some of the city&rsquo;s citadels of power: the Century Association, the Harvard Club, the Council of Foreign Relations and the board rooms of the New York Public Library and the Asia Society.</p><p>The composer Lukas Foss, a friend, occasionally tutored him in his piano playing at Mr. Elliott&rsquo;s Connecticut house. In 1983, his hospitable nature was exploited in a bizarre encounter that was to help inspire John Guare to write his award-winning play &ldquo;Six Degrees of Separation.&rdquo; An engaging young man had approached Mr. Elliot claiming to be the son of the actor Sidney Poitier and a classmate of one of Mr. Elliott&rsquo;s daughters. When the young man said he had been mugged, Mr. Elliott invited him into his home and gave him money and clothes. It later turned out that the man was an imposter who had bilked other prominent New Yorkers.</p><p>Osborn Elliott was born on Oct. 25, 1924, a descendant of Stephen Coerte van Voorhees, who came to New Amsterdam from Holland in the early 17th century. The boy grew up in a town house on East 62nd Street, where his parents, John Elliott, a stockbroker, and the former Audrey Osborn, a prominent real-estate broker who had campaigned for women&rsquo;s suffrage, entertained friends like the columnist Walter Lippmann and the author John Gunther.</p><p>Mr. Elliott attended the Browning School in New York, St. Paul&rsquo;s School in Concord, N.H., and Harvard. In World War II, he saw combat in the Pacific aboard the heavy cruiser Boston. Discharged as a lieutenant, junior grade, in 1946, he considered pursuing a career in finance or following his elder brother, John, into advertising. (John, known as Jock, became chairman of Ogilvy &amp; Mather. He died in 2005.) Instead, Mr. Elliott, who was known as Oz, chose journalism, joining <em>The New York Journal of Commerce</em> as a reporter. He had been working there for three years when his first wife, the former Deirdre Marie Spencer, who was working in the personnel department of <em>Time</em>, urged him to apply for a job with the magazine. He joined the staff as a contributing editor specializing in business and advanced to associate editor.</p><p>In 1955, <em>Newsweek</em>, historically the weaker of the two weeklies, asked Mr. Elliott to be its business editor, and he took the job, beginning his long association with the magazine.</p><p>In 1959 he published a book, &ldquo;Men at the Top&rdquo; (Harper), examining the qualities that had propelled executives to the upper ranks of corporations. In 1961, Philip L. Graham, the publisher of <em>The Washington Post</em>, bought controlling interest in <em>Newsweek</em> and promoted Mr. Elliott from managing editor to editor. He continued in the job when Katharine Graham assumed control after her husband&rsquo;s death in 1963.</p><p>Mr. Elliott&rsquo;s first marriage ended in divorce in 1972. The following year he married the former Inger Abrahamsen McCabe, founder of China Seas, a fabric and carpeting importer. She survives him, as do three daughters by his first marriage, Diana Elliott Lidofsky of Providence, R.I.; Cynthia Elliott of Manhattan; and Dorinda, of Brooklyn; three stepchildren, Kari McCabe of Manhattan, Alexander McCabe of Brooklyn and Marit McCabe of Manhattan; 17 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild. He is also survived by two foster sons, Samuel Wong of San Francisco and David Wong of St. Paul.</p><p>&ldquo;I was hooked on journalism,&rdquo; Mr. Elliott wrote in his <em>Times Magazine</em> article, recalling his earliest days as a reporter and summing up his career. &ldquo;Impressed by its demands for compression and clarity. Enchanted &mdash; mostly &mdash; by its practitioners and their often feigned cynicism. Flattered by the access it offered to heads of state, artists and tycoons. Infuriated by its imperfections &mdash; though as often as not, no doubt, blind to them as well. In love with its humor. Humbled, sort of, by its power.&rdquo;</p><p>-- http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/business/media/29elliott.html?_r=0&amp;pagewanted=print</p>"

From 1955 to 1986, he served as chairman of the board of the Pulitzer Prizes, the highest awards in journalism, which were established by his grandfather.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;&lt;strong\"><strong>Avid Collector of Art</strong></p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Though principally identified with journalism, Mr. Pulitzer was widely recognized for the art collection he began as a student at Harvard University, a collection that ultimately became one of the most important and generously shared in the world.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Art News magazine called Mr. Pulitzer&#39;s acquisitions &quot;one of the most brilliant and comprehensive collections of modern art in the country,&quot; and John Russell of <em>The New York Times</em> described it as &quot;one of the most discriminating&quot; in the nation, saying it was &quot;as remarkable for range as for quality.&quot;</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Born on May 13, 1913, Mr. Pulitzer was baptized in the Episcopal Church as Joseph Pulitzer 3d, but he later adopted the junior designation, which his father had dropped after the death of the first Joseph Pulitzer.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Pulitzer graduated from St. Mark&#39;s School in Southborough, Mass., in 1932, and went on to earn his bachelor&#39;s degree in fine art from Harvard in 1936. His newspaper career began with a stint as a cub reporter for <em>The San Francisco News</em> in 1935, the summer before his senior year at Harvard. After graduating, he joined The Post-Dispatch news staff and helped cover the Roosevelt-Landon campaign of 1936.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;&lt;strong\"><strong>&#39;Illuminate Dark Places&#39;</strong></p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Over the next 20 years, he worked in every department of the paper, including periods as editor of the daily magazine and editor of the Sunday rotogravure, or pictorial. In 1948, he became associate editor, a position he held until he became editor and publisher on the father&#39;s death in 1955.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">In an editorial he wrote on the day he took over the paper, a week after his father&#39;s death, Mr. Pulitzer pledged that <em>The Post-Dispatch</em> would maintain its tradition as one of the nation&#39;s great crusading papers. &quot;We will not only report the day&#39;s news but illuminate dark places, and, with a deep sense of responsibility, interpret these troublous times,&quot; he wrote.</p><p>At the time, besides the newspaper, Pulitzer holdings included only a radio and television station in St. Louis. But under Joseph Jr.&#39;s guidance, the company bought <em>The Arizona Daily Star </em>in Tucson and <em>The Southtown Economist</em> in Chicago, six other television stations and another radio station.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">In 1986, the Pulitzer company faced its greatest financial challenge. It had accrued a large debt, and a group of dissident relatives who owned stock in the privately owned company found a buyer, A. Alfred Taubman, a Michigan real estate developer, who offered $625 million for the company. The company successfully resisted the takeover bid, going public with the stock in order to offset its debt.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">In 1989, the company faced another challenge when Ralph Ingersoll 2d began publishing <em>The St. Louis Sun</em>. Although that newspaper failed after only seven months, its presence spurred the staid Post-Dispatch to improve its coverage.</p><p><strong>A Litany of Firsts</strong></p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">During Mr. Pulitzer&#39;s tenure as editor, <em>The Post-Dispatch</em> won five Pulitzers, including prizes for commentary and editorial cartooning. In 1987, Mr. Pulitzer received a special citation from the Pulitzer Prize board, citing his &quot;extraordinary services to American journalism and letters.&quot;</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\"><em>The Post-Dispatch</em> was one of the first newspapers in the country to oppose the war in Vietnam, and it was also one of the first to publish excerpts from the Pentagon Papers, the secret history of the war.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">It was also the first paper in the country to replace the old letter-press printing process with offset cold-type printing, which allowed high-quality color printing. &quot;Color was of special interest to an art connoisseur like Mr. Pulitzer,&quot; the company&#39;s statement yesterday said, &quot;and at his insistence <em>The Post-Dispatch</em> moved early into color publication.&quot;</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\"><strong>Hobby Became a Passion</strong></p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Pulitzer&#39;s art collecting began simply enough in 1936 when as an undergraduate he bought Modigliani&#39;s &quot;Elvira Resting at a Table.&quot; Three years later, at an auction in Lucerne, Switzerland, he bought &quot;Bathers With a Turtle,&quot; by Matisse for $2,400, a piece that is now easily worth 10,000 times that amount.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Pulitzer&#39;s father had no enthusiasm for modern art and sometimes took his friends into his son&#39;s room to ridicule the purchases. &quot;He was convinced that I had been fleeced by shrewd and unscrupulous New York dealers,&quot; Mr. Pulitzer said in a speech earlier this year.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Later, when his father realized the value of his collection and asked where he learned so much about art, Mr. Pulitzer told him that the knowledge had been acquired at Harvard and that the elder Pulitzer had footed the bill.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">The Pulitzer Collection came to include 86 pieces, all of which were shown at the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Mass., in 1988. The collection could have included Picasso&#39;s seminal work &quot;Demoiselles d&#39;Avignon,&quot; but Mr. Pulitzer had bought it before World War II and then donated it to the Museum of Modern Art.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Pulitzer always insisted on anonymity when lending his works to museums.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">His collection included Vuillard&#39;s &quot;Self Portrait,&quot; and &quot;Head of a Man&quot; by Degas, one of Monet&#39;s &quot;Water Lilies,&quot; as well as works by Braque, Picasso and Miro.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Pulitzer&#39;s first wife, Louise Vauclain, died in 1968. He married again in 1973, to the former Emily S. Rauh, who at the time was curator of the St. Louis Art Museum.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">He is survived by his son, Joseph Pulitzer 4th; his half brother, Michael of St. Louis, two sisters, Kate Davis Quesada of Hobe Sound, Fla., and Elinor Hempelmann of Rochester, and four grandchildren.</p></div></div></div>"

He was 82.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;artlcle\\&quot;\">The cause was lung cancer, his son Jay said.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;artlcle\\&quot;\">Scion of a family that owned <em>The Des Moines Register</em>, started <em>Look </em>magazine and came to dominate the newspaper business in Minneapolis for more than half a century, Mr. Cowles (rhymes with bowls) succeeded his father in 1961 as the editor of two Minneapolis papers, the morning <em>Tribune</em> and the evening <em>Star.</em> He became president and chief executive of The Minneapolis Star and Tribune Company (later renamed Cowles Media Company) in 1968.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;artlcle\\&quot;\">His tenure was rocky, but during it the papers won praise for aggressive local reporting, increased arts and science coverage and support for the civil rights movement and the Equal Rights Amendment in editorials. (Though he was generally described as a progressive liberal, Mr. Cowles served on a White House committee in 1965 to generate support for President Johnson&#39;s war policies.)</p><p class=\"\\&quot;artlcle\\&quot;\">The company&#39;s fortunes declined in the late 1960s, however, after several unsuccessful acquisitions, including <em>Harper&#39;s</em> magazine and the publisher Harper &amp; Row. In 1979, The Star and Tribune Company bought <em>The Buffalo Courier-Express</em> but was forced to close it three years later.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;artlcle\\&quot;\">In 1982, the company merged <em>The Star and The Tribune </em>and cut its work force, prompting the editor of the merged papers to quit in protest. Mr. Cowles subsequently fired the publisher and assumed the role himself. But just a few months later, in early 1983, the board of Cowles Media, which included his sister and two cousins, dismissed him as publisher and head of the company as well.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;artlcle\\&quot;\">He remained on the board until 1984 and into the 1990s continued to control a substantial percentage of company stock through his management of a family trust. Cowles Media was sold to the McClatchy Company in 1998.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;artlcle\\&quot;\">Beyond his turbulent stewardship of the newspapers, Mr. Cowles was known in Minneapolis and St. Paul for his philanthropy and his belief that arts institutions and sports teams were necessary for cities to grow and thrive. In 1960, he served on a steering committee -- and by most accounts was its leading voice -- that persuaded the British director Tyrone Guthrie to establish a resident theater company in Minneapolis to perform classic works in repertory. He then helped raise $2.2 million, and the Guthrie Theater opened in 1963 with a production of &quot;Hamlet.&quot; It became a model for nonprofit theaters across the country. Four decades later, he was co-chairman of the architecture committee for the new Guthrie Theater that opened in 2006.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;artlcle\\&quot;\">In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Mr. Cowles was active in the construction of the Metrodome, a state-financed domed stadium in downtown Minneapolis for the city&#39;s two major sports franchises, the Minnesota Twins and the Minnesota Vikings.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;artlcle\\&quot;\">His position on the project was controversial. Opponents, including staff members at <em>The Minneapolis Tribune</em>, thought it was a clear conflict of interest for the owner of a newspaper to take a public position on an important local issue it was covering. In 1979, staff members placed an ad in their own paper disassociating themselves from the company&#39;s involvement.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;artlcle\\&quot;\">The Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome opened in 1982; the Twins have since moved to Target Field.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;artlcle\\&quot;\">Mr. Cowles said in a 2010 interview that the impetus for his support of the Guthrie and the Metrodome were the same.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;artlcle\\&quot;\">&quot;Strengthening the cultural organization and life of the Twin Cities was not only going to make life more interesting and attractive for our families,&quot;&nbsp; he said, &quot;but was going to attract business and keep business here in town, and it was going to be just plain good business.&quot;</p><p class=\"\\&quot;artlcle\\&quot;\">Mr. Cowles was born on May 27, 1929, in Des Moines, Iowa, where his grandfather, Gardner Cowles, had been publisher of <em>The Des Moines Register</em> since 1903. His father, John, and his uncle Gardner Cowles Jr., known as Mike, founded Look magazine. John Cowles Sr. bought <em>The Minneapolis Star</em> in 1935 and moved his family to Minneapolis in 1938.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;artlcle\\&quot;\">The next year, the family business bought <em>The Minneapolis Journal</em> and merged it with <em>The Star</em>, and then added <em>The Minneapolis Tribune</em> in 1941. Young John graduated from the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and Harvard, and spent two years in the Army before joining the family business as a reporter.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;artlcle\\&quot;\">After his dismissal from the company in 1983, Mr. Cowles began a somewhat eclectic career. He studied agricultural economics, taught aerobics, toured in the United States and Europe with a modern dance company, and helped establish a women&#39;s professional fast-pitch softball league. He also continued his arts philanthropy around the Twin Cities; most recently, the Cowles Center, a theater devoted to dance, opened in Minneapolis last fall.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;artlcle\\&quot;\">Besides his son John III, known as Jay, Mr. Cowles is survived by his wife, the former Jane Sage Fuller, who is known as Sage Fuller Cowles and whom he married in 1952; another son, Charles; a daughter, Jane Sage Cowles; a stepdaughter, Tessa Flores; a sister, Sarah Cowles Doering; a brother, Russell; 10 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.</p>"

He was 93.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">He earned a law degree by the age of 29 while moving through newspapers in Oklahoma, Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee, and later became well versed in the financial side of the business, but Mr. Hills never strayed far from the newsroom.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Even as editor of <em>The Free Press</em>, he could not resist the lure of reporting -- a predilection that won him a Pulitzer Prize in 1955 for coverage of labor negotiations between the United Automobile Workers and the automakers. He later revealed that no less a figure than Henry Ford II had been a crucial source.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Five years later, as editor of <em>The Miami Herald</em>, he directed the newspaper&#39;s coverage of mob bosses living in the area, a series called &#39;&#39;Know Your Neighbor,&#39;&#39; which won that newspaper its first Pulitzer Prize.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Most of all, according to journalists who knew him, Mr. Hills saw probing, objective journalism as a calling and a public service. Mr. Hills -- an employee and friend of the late John S. Knight, who, with his brother James, owned the Knight newspaper group -- had sought to make the sharp, the curious, the critical and the crusading professionals around him adopt his standards of fairness, objectivity and excellence.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">&#39;&#39;He knew full well the kind of journalism he had come into, a journalism of faction and interests and parochialism and provincialism, and of a brawling independence as well,&#39;&#39; said Hodding Carter, speaking of the 1920&#39;s and 1930&#39;s -- when Mr. Hills covered everything from lynchings to the crime career of Charles (Pretty Boy) Floyd.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">&#39;&#39;But,&#39;&#39; Mr. Carter continued, &#39;&#39;he believed so strongly in the implications of a free press that he became one of the guys who helped to guide us into the period in which the adoption of standards and the notion of a semi-profession, with real connection to principle, and with the idea that the news came first and public interest came first.&#39;&#39;</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Carter, who is president of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, added: &#39;&#39;He came up wanting above all else to be a good newspaperman, a good journalist. He became, in effect, the prime minister for Jack Knight as he created a newspaper organization that was solidly successful economically and held to the old values in journalism throughout.&#39;&#39;</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Hills was born in Egg Creek Township, near Granville, N.D., in 1906. The family moved to Utah after his mother&#39;s death in 1911. It was in that state that he took his first job at a newspaper, sweeping floors at <em>The Price News Advocate</em>.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">He received his college education at Brigham Young University and the University of Missouri. While working as a reporter and editorial writer at <em>The Oklahoma City Times</em>, which he joined in 1929, he earned a law degree. He later worked for that newspaper&#39;s competitor, <em>The Oklahoma News</em>, a Scripps-Howard newspaper, before introducing himself to John Knight in 1942.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">According to the obituary in <em>The Detroit Free Press</em> yesterday, Mr. Hills, looking for a new job, asked to meet with Mr. Knight, who, with his brother, owned <em>The Akron Beacon-Journal, The Detroit Free Press</em> and <em>The Miami Herald</em>. Mr. Knight agreed to take him on as a news editor at <em>The Herald</em>. He soon became managing editor.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">When the government rationed newsprint at the height of the war, Mr. Hills persuaded Mr. Knight to cut back on advertising to allow full space for war coverage.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Some of the reporting he made room for was his own, as he served briefly as a war correspondent for <em>The Herald</em>, and filed reports from the Far East, the Middle East and Latin America -- an area of the world that fascinated him. At The Herald, he supported extensive coverage of Latin America.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Even as the head of professional groups, he found a way to get back to his reporting roots. In 1962, touring the Soviet Union with 12 editors -- at the time he was president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors -- he got nationwide attention, reporting an interview with the Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">As John Knight&#39;s chief lieutenant, Mr. Hills served for the better part of three decades -- from 1951 to 1979 -- as executive editor or publisher of both <em>The Herald</em> and <em>The Free Press</em>.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Alvah Chapman, who, like Mr. Hills, served as a chief executive of Knight Ridder, said yesterday: &#39;&#39;Lee, of course, was both a business operator and a journalist. He was responsible for the business success as well as the editorial success of <em>The Detroit Free Press</em>. But he was best known for editorial skills and news skills.&#39;&#39;</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Hills and Mr. Chapman, at Mr. Knight&#39;s behest, arranged the 1974 merger of Knight Newspapers Inc. with Ridder Publications Inc., producing a newspaper group that boasted a greater circulation than any of its rivals -- until the rapid growth of <em>USA Today</em> put the Gannett Company into the lead.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Hills was the first chairman and chief executive of the merged newspaper group. He retired as editorial chairman in 1981.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Hills was also an active philanthropist in both Detroit and Miami. Mr. Carter credits Mr. Hills with persuading the Knight brothers to set up the Knight Foundation with gifts amounting to more than $400 million. He also served as president of the Inter-American Press Association -- through which he met his third wife, Tina Ramos Hills.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Mr. Hills is survived by his wife and by Ronald Hills of Saratoga, Calif., his son with his first wife, Leona Hass, whom he divorced in 1944. His second wife, Eileen Whitman Hills, whom he married in 1948, died in 1961. He is also survived by two sisters, Louise Elwood, of Seattle, and BeverLee Margolis, of Mercer Island, Wash.; a brother, Stanley Hills, of Mercer Island; two grandsons and three great-grandsons.</p><p class=\"\\&quot;article\\&quot;\">Allen H. Neuharth, a colleague of Mr. Hills at <em>The Herald</em> and later, as founder of <em>USA Today</em>, a competitor, said yesterday: &#39;&#39;Among journalists, he was a reporter who never stopped being a reporter, even though he went on to be an executive and a publisher. But he retained his reporter&#39;s instincts and sensibility, and that motivated everything he did in his newspaper decisions.&#39;&#39;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"
