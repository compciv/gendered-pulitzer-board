# Automated Gender Analysis of the Pulitzer Prize Board

__Disclaimer:__ This project [is meant to be one of several example projects showing how effectively and industriously we can use public data to do gender classification](http://www.compciv.org/assignments/projects/gender-detector-data/) if we don't care about statistics or real-world complexities or computational efficiency. It is not meant to be an actual study or a display of programming best practices.

## Introduction

This is an automated analysis of the gender makeup of the Pulitzer Prize Board membership since 1968, [according to the Pulitzer website](http://www.pulitzer.org/board/1968). Preliminary findings indicate that currently, men outnumber women on the Pulitzer Prize board by a factor of roughly 1 to 3. And apparently, there were no women on the board at all before 1980.


### Methodology and caveats

The methodology of the gender detection is to use the dirt-cheap super naive and ethnocentric algorithm developed in the [babynames-gender-detector homework](http://www.compciv.org/assignments/exercise-sets/0020-gender-detector-set).

Each [Pulitzer board has its own page](http://www.pulitzer.org/board/2015), and, if you know how to use the web inspector and how to parse the kind of JSON that Drupal expels for an Angular-heavy interface, you can extract the raw data fields for each board member, including first and last names.

The caveats are basically: 

- Our gender detection data is super naive
- I don't fully understand why the backend doesn't serve board member data for all the years. That's why this starts at 1968.


### Past research and articles

Gender bias is alleged across all facets of media, so it makes sense to investigate the awards side of it. However, I haven't seen a lot of studies specific about the gender makeup of the awards-winners being heavily biased. However, it's significantly harder to reduce Pulitzer winners to a single byline. Though given the general skew in [sheer number of bylines for men versus women](http://www.womensmediacenter.com/pages/the-problem), one might expect that women overall have a statistically lesser chance of having work that appears in front of the Pulitzer committee.

My choice of looking at the Pulitzer committee is for pragmatic reasons. It's a body composed of individuals with easily discernible first names. And that is good for my [humble gender-detector algorithm](http://www.compciv.org/assignments/exercise-sets/0020-gender-detector-set).

It's worth noting industry numbers on [women in newspaper leadership](http://www.scripps.ohiou.edu/wjmcr/vol01/1-2a.HTM)

An aside: author Nicola Griffith examined the Pulitzer book awards from 2000 to 2015 and whether the winning books could be said to be primarily about women or from a woman's point of view: [Books About Women Donâ€™t Win Big Awards: Some Data](http://nicolagriffith.com/2015/05/26/books-about-women-tend-not-to-win-awards/) .




## Methodology and Caveats

Technical note: Why does this study limit itself to 1968? Because I don't have time to reverse-engineer the [data-structure of this Angular-heavy site](http://www.pulitzer.org/cache/api/1/global.json). Even though there are webpages for every board since 1917, they don't seem to be serialized in the same way as the years [1968-and-on](pulitzer-taxonomy.csv). Oh well.


The automated analysis detects gender by using the Social Security Administration's baby name data. If a name, such as "Joseph", has more recorded baby boys than baby girls in the SSA records, than "Joseph" is considered by the algorithm to be a name likely given to a man. Yes that's how basic the algorithm is. 

No attempt at disambiguating the guess was done for close-calls (though there don't seem to be many of those) -- and people such as __C.K.McClatchy__ are just left out.

However, a quick spot-check of the Pulitzer website seems to confirm the broad generalizations of the analysis. For example, the algorithm did not find a single woman on the board in the 1970s.

For reference, this is a picture of the [1970 board membership](http://www.pulitzer.org/board/1970):

## How to use it

Note: if you want to __clone__ this repo from Github, run this:

    git clone https://github.com/compciv/gendered-pulitzer-board

It will create a new sub-folder named `gendered-pulitzer-board`. This repo includes the `tempdata` folder: you should delete it manually and run all the scripts to see the project build itself from scratch.

Simply run the following scripts provided in this repo in this order:


### fetch_gender_data.py

Downloads the raw [babyname data from the Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html) and unpacks it into the __tempdata/babynames__ directory.


### wrangle_gender_data.py

Selects and compiles the baby name records for every five years between 1900 and 1991, and adds the records for 2014.

### fetch_pulitzer_board_pages.py

Scrapes the raw JSON corresponding to each board page on pulitzer.org.

For example, here's the 1980 board's webpage: http://www.pulitzer.org/board/1980

Here's the corresponding scraped JSON file: [tempdata/pages/1980.json](tempdata/pages/1980.json)

Note: I wouldn't read too much into this script; the AngularJS-heavy Pultizer.org has a fairly unorthodox front-end...no HTML parsing was even done.

### wrangle_pulitzer_board_data.py

Once the JSON files corresponding to each board page were downloaded, I extracted the specific fields I needed for the analysis, particularly the year of membership for each person, and their first and last name (mostly, their first name).

This script produces: [tempdata/wrangled_data.csv](tempdata/wrangled_data.csv)

### classify.py

For each row in [tempdata/wrangled_data.csv](tempdata/wrangled_data.csv), I use the `detect_gender()` function in the __gender.py__ script to determine the likely gender of the name. 

The `extract_usable_name()` function uses this incredibly naive algorithm to extract the "usable" first name from a given first name string:

- `namestr` is something like `"William B"`
- split `namestr` by whitespace
- select the first element, i.e. `"William`

This means that poor `"C.K."` of Charles McClatchy fame will not be joining our analysis...


A new file -- [tempdata/classified_data.csv](tempdata/classified_data.csv) -- is produced. Basically, it's wrangled_data.csv with three new columns:

- gender
- ratio (the likelihood/bias of the baby boy vs girl numbers)
- usable_name - the partial string extracted from `first_name` to do the classification.


### analyze.py

Reads [tempdata/classified_data.csv](tempdata/classified_data.csv) and produces the output seen at the bottom of this README's analysis.



### Ancillary files

Here are some supporting files. You don't actually _run_ these, but they are called by the other files.

### settings.py

This contains constants, like `DATA_DIR`, that are shared across several of the scripts.


### gender.py

This contains the code to load the wrangled gender data and the `detect_gender()` function.

### pulitzer-taxonomy.csv

Um...just something I had to create for myself to efficiently scrape Pulitzer.org's weird Angular-Drupal setup. 








## Analysis

The female/male ratio for the following facets were calculated

- Across the entire membership since 1968
- Across the membership for each decade
- Across the membership in each given year


In the time period of 1968 to the current year, an estimated __40+ women__ have served on the Pulitzer Prize board compared to __170+ men__.

The [2015 board membership](http://www.pulitzer.org/board/2015) was composed of 6 women and 12 men, according to a manual count; the automated analysis counted 6 and 11, respectively, apparently not being able to classify one of the male names. The makeup of the 2015 board is 33% women, which is the tied with 1997 as the highest rate of any year.

According to the automated analysis, the 1970s did not see a single woman on the Pulitzer Board. In the 1980s, about 10% of the board members were women.
